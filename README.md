Branding / web development / social strategy

Thank you for visiting my gitHub repository. My name is Kai. I am very new to gitHub. I love web design, especially front-end, CSS stuff. My short-term personal improvement goals are to learn Sass and to become more fluent in PHP. In the most immediate sense, I am becoming acquainted with gitHub while simultaneously launching my web design and building services as SCXN.

Truthfully, I am still discovering my long-term web development goals. I know my passion is for the style and aesthetics of web design combined with cutting edge techniques for piping, synthesizing, exhibiting and interpreting meaning from data. I trust the gitHub community will help focus those endeavors.

Thank you again for your time and consideration. Please feel free to contact me

Best,
