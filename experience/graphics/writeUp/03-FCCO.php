                                An infestation of self-hating socially progressive conversos descended upon a Christian church in Oakland CA.  By the end of 2008, the church was almost in complete moral, architectural and financial ruin when its last white hat agent, the church's administratrix had covertly contracted SCXN to overcome the communist onslaught by promoting the church campus in the community as a premier San Francisco Bay Area venue, mobilizing the church out from under the thumb of a highly organized and tenatious WRM syndicate.

                               SCXN was tasked with optimizing old, low-resolution photographs and creating a series of ad campaigns for print and screen.
