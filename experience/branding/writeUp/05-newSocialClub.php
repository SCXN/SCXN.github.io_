                                I learned fashion designers have excellent spatial reasoning that almost trumps that of anyone else.  At SCXN we're still working on the ultimate vision mentally projected by New Social Club's chief designer, Jill Creates, as it effectively defies established UX theory.

                                    An entity truly original in aesthetic but also in function is the beast SCXN has been commissioned to wrestle.  Until that beast is sufficiently tamed, we've agreed, punchy and fun is the tight dimensionality along which something authentically new may really be minted into this lie, this wobbly world of 3D repetition.
