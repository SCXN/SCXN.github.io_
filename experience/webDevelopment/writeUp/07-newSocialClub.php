                                The objective set before us at SCXN was to build, fashion house, New Social Club a blog inspired but a party frock.  Jill, principle couturier, brought over “Sylvia”, an ornately constructed party dress.  It was to be my only guidance for what was to evolve into a jiving good time of a blog.
