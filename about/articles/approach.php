                        As emphasized in the art of perfumery, crafting a simulation of the real thing, is often not a straight forward endeavor, and resolves in many delicate layers.  It's trickery.  And that's what we're doing here at SCXN--consipiring to trick the senses.

                        You are not your logo, but somehow we want your entire brand to be summed up in a single, focussed vision.  This is what is thought of as merely a commercial label although it's really much more.  Your graphic representation is metaphysical.  A phenomenon of Identity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At SCXN, your Identity is sacred.
