                        It's established science that Dr. Frankenstein harnessed JS to animate his fateful monster.  At SCXN, we wield similar exotic forces.

                        Such supernature, namely JS (Javascript), coaxes your website to life.  If your endeavor was a theater and your website was its stage, JS is the script that all of the players on-stage must follow.  Whenever there's a spit-take, when someone exits stage-left, any action at all, it's an esoteric drive responsible called JS.

                        At SCXN, your Script is sacred.
