                        HTML5: Meaningful
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        In consultations, I repeat ad nauseam, "meaning".  Ask my clients:  I am somewhat of a broken record, constantly prompting, "great! But what does it mean?  Is there meaning?" I don't <i>mean</i> to be a relgious fanatic, but semantics and meaning are at the core of HTML5; by that token, we're riding this train until it reaches the end of its line, and then we're hitching a free ride back.
                        </p>
                        <p>The coductor hates us but we're winning and, best of all, it's perfectly legal.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Being asked what we mean can feel like we're being confronted.  Let;s face it.  It's confrontational.  "What do you mean?", or "What is the meaning of this?" are questions that feel bold, and SCXN helps you roar back in reply.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At SCXN, your Meaning is sacred.
                    </p>
